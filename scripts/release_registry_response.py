"""Adapt crates.io transport responses into typed release observations.

The registry replies in two JSON shapes and uses HTTP status codes to report
absence and transient failures. This adapter owns that transport vocabulary:
it maps status and schema into domain observations, leaving
:mod:`release_reconcile_crates` to decide what those facts permit.

Keeping the two apart is what lets each be reviewed on its own terms. This
module is where a schema surprise belongs — a record without a checksum, a
body that is neither shape, a history that disagrees with its own stated
total. The policy module never has to guess how the registry spells things,
and this one never has to know what a release intends to do.

The shapes, both taken from live responses rather than documentation:

- ``GET /api/v1/crates/<crate>/<version>`` answers ``{"version": {...}}`` —
  one record, for the version asked about.
- ``GET /api/v1/crates/<crate>`` answers ``{"versions": [{...}, ...]}``
  alongside ``crate`` — the crate's **entire publication history**. Probed on
  2026-10-23, ``serde`` returned all 316 of its versions and
  ``crate.num_versions`` said 316.

Nothing here performs network I/O; the caller records the response and passes
it in. Coverage lives in ``scripts/tests/test_release_reconcile_crates.py``.

    Notes
    -----
    HTTP 404 is the registry's absence observation; every other non-200 status
    and an absent or non-JSON body are indeterminate. A body that parses but
    does not fit either documented shape is a schema surprise, which raises
    :class:`RegistryResponseError` rather than being folded into uncertainty.

    A body that is JSON but neither crates.io shape, or one carrying a version
    record this module cannot read, raises :class:`RegistryResponseError`.
    The parsing helpers raise it while unpacking the parsed body, where the
    response shape and records are actually read.
