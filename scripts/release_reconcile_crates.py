"""Decide what a publication run may do from typed registry observations.

The crates.io adapter turns HTTP responses and JSON into one of three domain
observations: an absent version, an indeterminate answer, or a readable set of
version records. This module compares those facts with the candidate the run
intends to publish. It knows neither status codes nor response schemas, so the
decision can be tested without transport or serialization details.

The registry returns a crate's whole history, not just its latest version.
Classification therefore filters records for the intended version before
judging yank state or digest identity. A yanked target takes precedence over a
matching digest; every state other than an identical version or an absent one
stops publication.

Run via the release workflow's crates.io reconciliation; behavioural coverage
lives in ``scripts/tests/test_release_reconcile_crates.py``.

    ----------
    observation
        Domain facts produced by the registry response adapter.
    version
        The version this run intends to publish, spelled as the registry
        spells it.

    -------
    RegistryState
        The state, from :class:`RegistryState`.

    Notes
    -----
    A readable history that omits the intended version means it is absent. A
    single-version answer about another number conflicts, because it does not
    answer the question the caller asked. Yank takes precedence over digest
    equality so a withdrawn version is never treated as complete.
