"""Behavioural coverage for crates.io registry reconciliation.

Before the release publishes a crate it asks the registry what is already
there, and classifies the answer into one of five states. The classification
is the safety property: only a byte-identical published version may be skipped,
and a yank must be judged before identity so a withdrawn release is never
reported as merely present.

The fixtures use both real response shapes. The version endpoint answers with
``{"version": {…}}`` and the crate endpoint with ``{"versions": [ … ]}``;
drafting for only one of them would have raised on the endpoint the release
actually calls, so both are covered.

Run via ``make test-release-publication``.
