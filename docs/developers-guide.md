# Developers guide

This guide describes the day-to-day engineering workflow for Netsuke, with a
focus on writing and maintaining tests. It is the source of truth for how the
test suite is expected to be used by contributors.

## Quality gates

Run these commands before finalizing any change:

- `make check-fmt`
- `make lint`
- `make test`

When command output is long, preserve exit codes and logs:

    set -o pipefail
    make test 2>&1 | tee /tmp/netsuke-make-test.log

For documentation changes, also run:

- `make fmt`
- `make markdownlint`
- `make nixie`

## Test suite map

Netsuke uses a mixed strategy:

- Unit and integration tests live under `tests/` as ordinary Rust test files.
- Behavioural tests use Gherkin feature files in `tests/features/` and
  `tests/features_unix/`.
- Behavioural step definitions and fixtures live in `tests/bdd/`.
- Behavioural test discovery is defined in `tests/bdd_tests.rs`.

## Behavioural testing strategy

Behavioural tests run through `cargo test` using `rstest-bdd`, not a bespoke
runner. The `scenarios!` macro in `tests/bdd_tests.rs` discovers feature files
and binds a shared fixture entry point (`world: TestWorld`) to each generated
scenario test.

### State and isolation policy

- Scenario isolation is the default: scenario state must be recreated per test.
- Shared process-wide state is avoided unless infrastructure cost requires
  controlled reuse.
- Use `Slot<T>` for optional or replaceable scenario values.
- Use typed wrappers in `tests/bdd/types.rs` for step parameters to avoid
  ambiguous string-heavy signatures.

### Step authoring policy

- Keep `Given` steps for context and setup.
- Keep `When` steps for one observable action.
- Keep `Then` steps for user-visible outcomes, not internal implementation
  details.
- Prefer explicit, domain-focused helper functions over large step bodies.
- Keep step modules cohesive by domain (`cli`, `manifest`, `ir`, `stdlib`,
  `process`, `locale_resolution`).

### Compile-time safety

`rstest-bdd-macros` is configured with `strict-compile-time-validation`, so
missing or ambiguous step bindings should be treated as compile-time failures.

## rstest-bdd v0.5.0 migration usage

The migration plan is tracked in
`docs/execplans/rstest-bdd-v0-5-0-behavioural-suite-migration.md`.

The intended post-migration usage is:

- `rstest-bdd` and `rstest-bdd-macros` pinned to `0.5.0`.
- Prefer inferred step patterns for simple, no-argument steps when this
  reduces duplication and keeps feature wording clear.
- Use `rstest_bdd::async_step::sync_to_async` for manual sync-to-async wrappers
  and the concise wrapper aliases (`StepCtx`, `StepTextRef`, `StepDoc`,
  `StepTable`) where required.
- Introduce async step definitions only where asynchronous behaviour is natural
  and improves coverage.
- Keep async execution on Tokio current-thread runtime for behavioural tests.
- Restrict `#[once]` fixtures to expensive, effectively read-only
  infrastructure.

These points are strategy rules, not optional style guidance.

## How to add or update behavioural tests

1. Add or update the feature text in `tests/features/` or
   `tests/features_unix/`.
2. Implement or update matching steps under `tests/bdd/steps/`.
3. Reuse existing fixtures/helpers before adding new world state.
4. Add typed parameter wrappers in `tests/bdd/types.rs` when step arguments
   represent distinct domain concepts.
5. Run `cargo test --test bdd_tests` and then the full quality gates.

## Documentation upkeep

When test strategy or behavioural test usage changes, update this file in the
same change-set so the documented approach remains aligned with the codebase.
