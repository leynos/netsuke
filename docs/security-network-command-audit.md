# Audit of MiniJinja network and command helpers

This note captures a quick security and resilience review of the helper
functions exposed to MiniJinja templates from the `network` and `command`
stdlib modules. Each finding summarises the observed behaviour, the risk it
introduces, and concrete remediation tasks that would harden the helpers.

## Network helper findings

- [x] **Cache directories lack target validation and isolation.** *(Status:
  remediated in PR #219 on 19 October 2025.)* The `fetch` helper lets templates
  pick any `cache_dir`, accepts absolute paths, and opens them using the
  ambient filesystem capability (`open_cache_dir` / `write_cache`). A malicious
  manifest can therefore point the cache at arbitrary system locations such as
  `/etc/netsuke-cache` and plant attacker controlled data. *Remediation tasks:*
  - Require caches to reside under a dedicated workspace-relative directory
    (reject absolute or parent-relative paths) and create them via a sandboxed
    `Dir` root.
  - Consider exposing cache configurability only via trusted configuration,
    not per-template input.
  - **Remediation:** caches are now rooted beneath `.netsuke/fetch` within the
    workspace via `StdlibConfig`, which opens directories through a sandboxed
    `Dir` handle. Template code can no longer pass `cache_dir`, so per-template
    overrides now raise an error instead of redirecting caches outside the
    workspace.
- [x] **Outbound requests lack scheme and host validation.** *(Status:
  remediated on 20 October 2025.)* Because `fetch` accepts any URL, manifests
  can reach link-local metadata services (for example,
  `http://169.254.169.254/`) or other internal resources, yielding SSRF.
  *Remediation tasks:*
  - Provide an allowlist / blocklist mechanism (e.g. only `https://` hosts or
    specific domains) and allow administrators to disable outbound requests
    entirely for untrusted manifests.
  - **Remediation:** outbound requests now default to `https://` and are
    vetted against `--fetch-allow-scheme`, `--fetch-allow-host`, and
    `--fetch-block-host` CLI options. `--fetch-default-deny` switches the
    policy to "block by default" with an explicit allowlist. Policy violations
    surface as `InvalidOperation` errors without opening a network connection.
- [x] **Response bodies are read without a size limit.** `fetch_remote` reads
  the entire HTTP response into memory before returning or caching it. An
  attacker controlling the endpoint can stream unbounded data and exhaust
  memory or disk. *Remediation tasks:*
  - Impose a configurable maximum response size, aborting once the budget is
    exceeded and describing the limit in the error message so template authors
    understand the constraint.
  - Stream large downloads directly to cache files without buffering the whole
    body in memory.
  - **Remediation:** fetch now enforces a configurable byte budget (default
    8Â MiB) and aborts requests once the limit is exceeded, quoting the
    configured threshold in the error. Cached downloads stream directly to disk
    and partial files are cleaned up when errors occur; cache reads reuse the
    same guard so stale oversized entries fail fast.

## Command helper findings

- [ ] **Arbitrary command execution is always enabled.** The `shell` and `grep`
  filters launch external programmes via the system shell, with a five-second
  timeout. There is no option to disable them or to restrict the commands that
  can run. If templates originate from untrusted sources this yields instant
  remote command execution. *Remediation tasks:*
  - Allow integrators to opt out of registering these filters when the
    template is not fully trusted.
  - Provide an allowlist-based command runner (e.g. declarative mapping of
    helper names to binaries) so manifests can reference vetted utilities
    without shell access.
- [ ] **Helpers buffer stdout/stderr without limits.** Both filters capture the
  entire command output into memory before returning it. A command that writes
  an unbounded stream will lead to memory exhaustion or at least prolonged
  blocking. *Remediation tasks:*
  - Enforce maximum output sizes with clear errors when exceeded.
  - Stream results to temporary files when callers opt in to large outputs.

## Next steps

The tasks above can be implemented incrementally. A good first milestone is to
make the risky capabilities opt-in, protecting hosts that evaluate manifests
from semi-trusted sources. Subsequent iterations can tighten resource limits
and add streaming code paths to improve robustness for legitimate large
workloads.
